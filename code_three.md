## Creative Code Exercise Three: Taroko Gorge Re-Remix

This week, you'll be creating a conceptual successor to Nick Montfort's *Taroko Gorge* by combining remixed, public domain texts into a generated HTML story or poem. Follow the steps from our in-class [combinatorial texts exercise](combine_texts.md), and convert the results to a HTML page. This doesn't need to be fancy, and should be inspired by the web poetics of *Taroko Gorge* and its remixes - it can cycle through possibilities or use a static display at this stage. 

Here's the process from the class demo:

- [Generating the HTML poem](https://chatgpt.com/share/679c0278-5cd4-8005-8933-be869d7d8f43)

As with our interactive fiction, upload your HTML version to GitHub and use the Pages link to submit to Moodle before Tuesday's class.
