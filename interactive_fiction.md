## Interactive Fiction

The first project is a work of interactive fiction created in Inform 7. This project should be developed using a combination of the work from your previous creative code exercises (the [imagined room](code_one.md) and [conversation simulator](code_two.md)) and the in-class demos. This work should be extended using genAI coding methods to rewrite and extend your code, as modeled during the demos. Refer to the [completed example](./inform_three/) for a model of what a complete work should include.

This project should include:

- **Three distinct rooms (6 points):** Each room should be described with a sense of personality and cohesion (watch for over-relying on generative AI here, as this can result in repetition and trite prose) and contain interactive elements that must be manipulated for the player to advance. Start from the examples and challenges in the class demo, and consider using genAI to prototype each additional room and puzzle with your initial room as an example.
- **At least two characters with conversations (4 points):** Characters should have meaningful interactions, using at least one of the dialogue techniques modeled in class. These characters should have consistent and potentially useful insights to offer the player with connections to the rest of the interactive fiction or simulation you've designed.
- **At least one reachable ending (3 points):** **Design at least one satisfying conclusion that players can reach based on their actions or choices. This can result from conversation or exploration, but the player should have to pass through several elements of the experience to get to this result.
- **Published online (2 points):** Release your work as an HTML file with an interpreter and the source code, and share it via GitHub Pages or another accessible hosting platform. Feel free to password protect your prototype if you prefer not to make it public at this stage.

You are free to use one of your previous narrative concepts or to develop something new: remember, for this project, our focus is on expanding and iterating on your existing code with the assistance of GenAI tools.
