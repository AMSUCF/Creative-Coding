## Text Generator

The second project is a text generator with dynamic output built for the web. This project should be developed using a combination of the work from your previous creative code exercises (the [Taroko Gorge inspired remix](code_three.md) and [Bluesky Bot](code_four.md)) and the in-class demos. This work should be extended using genAI coding methods to rewrite and extend your code, as modeled during the demos. 

This project should include:

- **Text elements sourced from public domain or creative commons work (5 points):** Using the Python distant reading methods deployed in the remix assignment, source at least some of your text components (collections of nouns, verbs, phrases, etc.) from existing textual sources. Sources should be cited somewhere in the credits of the generator.
- **A working grammar with dynamic output (5 points):** Using either Tracery or your own / generated JavaScript code modeled on methods demonstrated in class, build a working dynamic grammar that generates new textual content either dynamically or on demand. This content should incorporate the text elements sourced from Python as well as your own structure or components to build new coherent or poetic output.
- **A dynamic visual or stylistic component (3 points):** Using dynamic replacement of elements on the page (such as stylesheets, colors, or images), include a dynamic visual element that changes with the reload or progression of the grammar. This can be built using Tracery and P5.js, or your own / generated codebase.
- **Published online (2 points):** Publish your working, web-ready generator on GitHub Pages or another accessible hosting platform.
