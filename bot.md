## Bluesky Bot

In this assignment, youâ€™ll use [BlueBotsDoneQuick](https://bluebotsdonequick.com/) and [Tracery](https://tracery.io/) to design an original generative grammar for both text and images, tailored to post on a Bluesky account. Use the [sample code](bot.json) and [deployed bot sample](https://bsky.app/profile/blueskiesbot.bsky.social) as a guide, and play with abstractions and combinatorial poetics.

As you work, try using generative AI tools to:
- Develop the structure of your SVG. Iterate through this process without mentioning Tracery to focus on creating a representation of the abstraction, landscape, etc you want to generate.
- Generate possiblities for each element of your grammar. Generate as JSON, and use prompts like websafe color names, values within a range, etc, to speed up your Tracery grammar crafting process.
- Develop your initial Tracery grammar. Make sure to check that the grammar ties the output to the origin so that it will work in the Bluesky pot structure.

Make sure to select "display source" when deploying your bot, and set your bot to post every twelve hours. Submit the link to your bot's hosted source code [as per the class example](https://bluebotsdonequick.com/bots/blueskiesbot.bsky.social) to the Moodle for credit for this exercise.
