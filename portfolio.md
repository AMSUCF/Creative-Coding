## Portfolio

As we're approaching the end of the semester, we're going to think about the extent to which generative AI will become part of our workflows. For this exercise, build a simple portfolio combining the web outputs of at least three of your experiments from this semester.

### Prompts and/or Code?

For this exercise, think intentionally about what you code yourself versus the deployment of the available genAI tools and assistants. Consider the tools we've discussed that are trying to transform this type of web develoment: from AI code editor [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/) to [GitHub Copilot Workspace](https://githubnext.com/projects/copilot-workspace/) and [GitHub Spark](https://githubnext.com/projects/github-spark), there's been a major investment in the next generation of "text-to-code" alongside less prompt-based interfaces that integrate human expertise. We've now seen similar moves across multiple media industries, with implications for publishing, art, game design, software, etc. 

You can either create a new GitHub repository or work in one of your existing projects. Remember to distinguish the names of separate .html files, and use the filename index.html for your main page if you decide to build and link multiple pages. 

- **Document your methods** Provide brief documentation (description and discussion of all tools / methods used) for each of the three exercises included. This documentation should be available as part of the portfolio, and thoughtfully integrated into your design (5 points).
- **Build a playful, compelling interface** Build an interface, such as a navigation menu, with links to subpages or subsections as preferred. Consider expectations of modern web development, including responsive design. (5 points)
- **Finish and incorporate a p5 or ml5 experience** Working from either your p5.js or ml5.js prototype, polish your experience and incorporate it as a featured interactive portion of your portfolio. (5 points)

Submit your GitHub Pages link to the Moodle.
