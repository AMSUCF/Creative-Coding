## Building a Web-based Generator from Data

For this exercise, we'll begin to build our web-based generator using one method for combining both extracted data from texts and a Tracery grammar. 

- Use your local retrieval-augmented generation set-up to explore a set of texts and pull characteristic passages and themes. Break down sections of this into a pattern for your generator: for instance, my example works from science fiction texts with descriptions of aliens, and uses those passages as models for the grammar for a "sightings" generator.
