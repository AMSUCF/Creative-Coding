## Creative Code Exercise Two: Conversation Simulators

This week, you'll be be expanding your previous Inform 7 room to include an interactive agent. Your agent should respond to conversational provocations after being greeted, and provide at least ten different responses to player input. Use our model from [the robot demo](inform_two.md) as a starting point, then iterate using the examples and challenges in [the philosophical robot demo](inform_three.md) to add on and vary the conversational output.

As you work, consider the challenges of conversational nuance and cohesion. Can you create an illusion of greater understanding of the player's input? Try using any generative AI tool to prototype additional code or extend your conversational framework.

As before, feel free to go beyond those requirements or to experiment with more complex possibilities. Copy your finished room to a plain text file (.txt) and upload it to the Moodle assignment before class, and we'll take a look at everyone's creations when we meet on Tuesday!
