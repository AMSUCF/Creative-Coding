## Inform 7 Demo: Iterating and Combining

This week, we'll work through the process of building a prototype that meets all the requirements of the [Interactive Fiction](interactive_fiction.md) assignment, including releasing and uploading. As we work through these steps, we'll discuss where and when generative AI is helpful for coding and debugging:

1. **Extend your rooms** Work from at least one functional room definition to build out your environment.
2. **Create a new character** Iterate from an existing conversational character, and think about how to differentiate this interaction while keep enough consistency to clarify the world and support the player.
3. **Define clear endings** Keeping in mind the iterations of the challenges in the [philosophical robot extended demo](./inform_two/), define at least one but ideally more endings with a sense of stakes and progression.
4. **Release with cover art** Name your file Cover.jpg and include it in the materials folder corresponding with your project to release, as in the robot example.
5.  **Publish a playable version on GitHub Pages (or your own site if preferred)**

    -   **Steps**:

        1.  **Create a GitHub Repository**: Open GitHub Desktop and
            click on \"File -> New Repository\". Fill in the necessary
            details like the repository name, description, and local
            path. Click \"Create Repository\".

        2.  **Open the Repository in Visual Studio Code**: Once the
            repository is created, click \"Open in Visual Studio Code\"
            in GitHub Desktop. This will allow you to start editing
            files in VS Code.

        3.  **Copy the released version of the project**: Navigate to your Inform 7 project folder, and make sure to copy all the files in Release exactly as they appear. This includes the subfolder with the interpreter.

        5.  **Commit and Push Changes**: Go back to GitHub Desktop, and
            you should see the new files you created. Write a commit
            message like \"Added project\". Then click \"Push origin\" to upload
            your changes to GitHub.

        6.  **Initialize GitHub Pages**: Go to your repository on
            GitHub.com. Click on the \"Settings\" tab, scroll down to
            the \"GitHub Pages\" section, and select the branch you want
            to use (usually main or master). Then select the root folder
            for the source. Save the settings, and GitHub will provide a
            link to view your site live.
