## Creative Code Exercise One: Imagined Rooms

This week, you'll be building a detailed environment for a player to explore using Inform 7's natural language syntax. This is an exercise that melds "code" and "text" in the act of creative writing, so please feel free to use any type of environment you want for your concept - this can be a room you've imagined, or a room you've visited, or a room that exists in a media franchise of which you are a fan. For this exercise, feel free to work from the [first demo](inform_one.md) code directly and rewrite names and descriptions to fit your vision.

Don't worry if something you've described isn't working quite as you imagined it: we'll discuss debugging when we meet. Test as you go using the built-in parser interface we previewed in class. Try incorporating elements of the three challenges from class into your design.

Your finished room should be about 500 words, including both "code" and "text." Feel free to go beyond those requirements or to experiment with more complex possibilities. Copy your finished room to a plain text file (.txt) and upload it to the Moodle assignment before class, and we'll take a look at everyone's creations when we meet on Tuesday!
